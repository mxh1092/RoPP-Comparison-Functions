# RoPP-Comparison-Functions
A library of functions used to compare the positions of tracers returned by PEPT algorithms and their ground truth positions as prescribed in GATE simulations.

Most function have the ground truth particle positions, however for the multiple particle tracking, velocity, closepacked tracers, and trajectory linking test, the 'Keys' need to passed to the appropriate comparison functions.
