# RoPP-Comparison-Functions
A library of functions used to compare the positions of tracers returned by PEPT algorithms to their ground truth positions as prescribed in GATE simulations.

Most function have the ground truth particle positions, however for the multiple particle tracking, velocity, closepacked tracers, and trajectory linking tests the 'Keys' need to be passed to the appropriate comparison functions.

The LoRs data generated for these test can be found here: https://edata.bham.ac.uk/653/
